            <h2>What We Offer</h2>
            <p>Abel Tasman Escape offers a one-stop-shop for your trip in the beautiful Abel Tasman National Park. We have a wide range of water-based activities for any age group. From canyoning in the luscious Torrent Bay River to Kayaking the serene waters of Anchorage Bay, where you will see the Water Taxi’s waiting to take you home. Don’t forget to keep an eye out for the seal pups and dolphins keeping our shorelines full of marine life, especially in the Tonga reserve.</p>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>Established in 1942, the Abel Tasman is New Zealand’s most popular national park. There is archaeological evidence to show the Abel Tasman was occupied by Maori around 700 years ago. The Abel Tasman Park was formed on the 16th of December 1942, 300 years to the day since Abel Tasman visited the area. Formation of the Abel Tasman National Park was largely due to the efforts of Mrs Perrine Moncrieff. The area already had several small scenic reserves at Fisherman and Adele Islands, Torrent Bay, Sandfly Bay and the area between Awaroa and Totaranui.</p>

            <h2>Kayaking</h2>
            <img src="images\kayaking2.jpg" width="350" height="250" class="float-img">
            <p class="Text">An overnight kayak trip is likely be the most amazing experience you will ever have in the outdoors.  Paddling along the Abel Tasman coastline during the day and then pulling your kayak up onto a beach to camp for the night is simply magical. Most kayaking trips leave from Marahau or use a water taxi to deliver your kayak to your starting point. Abel Tasman Escape is one of the longest standing kayaking companies in the Abel Tasman.</p>

            <h2>Canyoning</h2>
            <img src="images\canyon7.jpg" width="350" height="250" class="float-img">
            <p class="Text">We are fortunate to have amazing granite canyons beautifully sculpted by crystal clear water and surrounded by stunning native bush. Being located in the tropical north of the South Island means we’re far away from freezing cold rivers fed by snow melt. The Abel Tasman National Park has picture perfect golden sand beaches, turquoise waters and plenty of wildlife. Where else can you start and finish an exciting canyoning trip on a golden sand beach?</p>

            <h2>Water Taxi</h2>
            <img src="images\watertaxi.jpg" width="350" height="250" class="float-img">
            <p class="Text">Built specifically for the Abel Tasman coastline and unique tidal conditions, water taxis get you access to the Park’s secret spots, spectacular marine life and even into bush-fringed tidal inlets. Water taxis provide quick and convenient access to the six major bays along the spectacular Abel Tasman coastline. A trip in one of the smaller water taxis, past the succession of wide sweeping bays, is a quintessentially Kiwi experience.</p>
